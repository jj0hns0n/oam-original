 * Create a datasource. Attribution should be a short string which 
   will be used in the map display -- everything else is self explanatory.
 * Note the ID of the new datasource, displayed in the URL. 

 * Create a directory in /optistor/viz/openaerialmap/datasources/$YourID.
   YourId will be something like '12'.

 * Copy your geodata to this directory. This will need to be a geotiff, or 
   a set of geographic data tiles, or image with world file. If it is a set of
   tiles, an index should be built like this:

   gdaltindex index.shp `find /optistor/viz/openaerialmap/datasources/$YourID -name \*.tiff` 
   
   or similar. Your data should be properly overviewed, especially if it is
   large. 'gdaladdo your_image.tiff 2 4 8 16' can help here.
   
 * Create a data record. This will likely be a 'geotiff', even if it is not a
   tiff file,  or a tile index. 

   Extent should be a comma seperated list of left,bottom,right,top.

   Layername should be null.
 
   Data resolution is base data resolution in meters/pixel.

   min scale is the 'largest' scale that the map is displayed at: this 
   will likely be something like '100' or '1000'.

   max scale is the 'smallest' scale that the map is displayed at -- 
   this should be something like 25000 or 50000.

   The location of the data will be:

     /optistore/viz/openaerialmap/datasources/$YourId/yourfile.png

   or 
   
     /optistore/viz/openaerialmap/datasources/$YourId/index.shp

   Currently, the process to regenerate the map is manual,
   so after you do that, kick Chris to update the mapfile.
