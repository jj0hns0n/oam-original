featureserver-1.05,  Thu, 21 Jun 2007 04:19:00 -0400
 * Add temporary GeoJSON-spec tracking module. This module will eventually
   become the default JSON input/output, but right now, it's in a seperate
   module so people can have something different to code against.
 * Add support for content-negotiation in the Server. This is *only* an
   exact match, but I recommend that anyone posting content specify their
   'accept' header -- in the future, this may change, and by default
   browsers will get text/html content.
 * GeoRSS RSS 2.0 input for GeoRSS simple is now supported. 
 * Fix PostGIS to_wkt following report from Stephan Holl
